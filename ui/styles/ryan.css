/* 

to change any style, override them in this file. 
this way, the original is preserved and the changes are not destructive.

example:

if in style.css, there is a style like this:

.aclassname {
    font-size: 10px;
}

And you wanted to change the font size without affecting the style.css.
So you re-declare the css in ryan.css

.aclassname {
    font-size: 12px !important;
}

And then, git commit/push the changes, and it will reflect on the website.

If you are adding a new property to the same class, or a new property to a new class, then there is no need to declare
!important after the property.
